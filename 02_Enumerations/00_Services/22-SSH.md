##### Some Crash Course on SSH and PKI

- Generating SSh key pair
	- `ssh-keygen -b <4096, 2048, 1024>`   `-b` is for bit size
	- `id_rsa.pub` is our public key and `id_rsa` is for private key located under ~/.ssh
- Copying public key to remote server
	- `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/my_public_key.pub username@$ip_add`
- Authenticating 
	- `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@$ip_add` her we might need to change the permission of the key if get the key from a vuln machine
- Connecting
	- `ssh username@$ip_add -D 7777`   `-D` to specify port number for port forwarding 
	- `nc -nv $ip_add 22`

##### Exploit

- Look for specific version vuln
- If we have a username we can try to brute force it, without the username simply leave it alone.
- `ssl-heartbleed.nse` nmap script might come in handy
