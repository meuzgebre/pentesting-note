##### Enum

- `nc $ip_add 25` then we can verify if a user exist in the system
- after connecting to smtp we can use the following command to verify
	- `VRFY <username>` if we get `252` response that means the user exist 
	- we can write a python script to automate this enum. [smtp_brute.py](../../06_Scripts/smtp_brute.py)
