## Pentesting Methodology Notes

Welcome to my Pentesting Methodology Notes repository! Here, I document my journey as I explore the exciting world of penetration testing. These notes serve as a personal learning resource and reference guide for various pentesting techniques, tools, and methodologies.

### Usage

I used Obsidian as a note taking platform, to use this note effectively download this project, extract it to a folder and import it in to obsidian.

### Disclaimer
Please note that these notes are a work in progress and reflect my personal learning journey. While I strive for accuracy and completeness, I am not an expert in penetration testing, and these notes should not be considered as a comprehensive resource. Always verify information from multiple sources and exercise caution when applying techniques in real-world scenarios.

### Contributions
I welcome contributions, corrections, and suggestions from the community. If you have insights to share or would like to improve these notes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Hacking!
